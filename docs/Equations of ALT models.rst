Constructing an ALT model
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

ALT models are probability distributions with a stress dependent model replacing their scale (or rate) parameter. For example, the Weibull-Exponential model is obtained by replacing the :math:`\alpha` parameter with the equation for the exponential life-stress model as follows:

:math:`\text{Weibull PDF:} \hspace{40mm} f(t) = \frac{\beta t^{ \beta - 1}}{ \alpha^ \beta} .exp \left(-(\frac{t}{\alpha })^ \beta \right)`

to be written
