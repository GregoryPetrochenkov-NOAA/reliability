How to donate to the project
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The Python reliability library is free and open source, and it always will be. It aims to provide students and professionals alike with a set of powerful tools to make reliability engineering more efficient. Many of these tools are otherwise only found in commercial software which is prohibitively expensive, especially for individuals. I began developing this library while I was a student because I found there was nothing like it available for free.

Developing and maintaining this library is all done in my spare time and is a very time consuming process. If you would like to donate as a way of showing your appreciation, you can send a one off payment using `Paypal <https://paypal.me/MatthewReid854?locale.x=en_AU>`_ or a monthly payment by becoming a `GitHub Sponsor <https://github.com/sponsors/MatthewReid854>`_.

Your donation will be used on resources to help me improve the library including software and textbooks. If I get enough GitHub sponsors, I will be able to remove advertising from this documentation by paying for an Ad-free subscription on readthedocs.

Thank you to the following `reliability` donors for their generous support of open source development :)
