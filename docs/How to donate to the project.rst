How to donate to the project
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The Python reliability library is free, open source, and it always will be. It aims to provide students and professionals alike with a set of tools that you would otherwise only find in commercial software. Most commercial software is prohibitively expensive, especially for individuals, so I aim to bring these features to you for free by continuing to develop this library.

Developing and maintaining this library is all done in my free time and can be quite a time consuming process. If you would like to donate as a way of showing your appreciation, you can send a one off payment using `Paypal <https://paypal.me/MatthewReid854?locale.x=en_AU>`_ or a monthly payment by becoming a `GitHub Sponsor <https://github.com/sponsors/MatthewReid854>`_.

Your donation will be used on resources to help me improve the library including software and textbooks. If I get enough GitHub sponsors, I will be able to remove advertising from this documentation by paying for an Ad-free subscription on readthedocs.

Thank you for your support of open source development :)
